# Lazy On A Sunday Morning

A modpack purely designed to keep in line with Vanilla Minecraft yet adding some simple quality of life additions for entertainment and longevity of play.

## History

This modpack started as a basic set of mods for myself and my daughter to play Minecraft. I've played plenty of modpacks but she wasn't into the technical packs as much and as such wanted to play Vanilla whenever possible. One set of things we did agree on however, were some quality of life mods that made things far more simpler and less frustrating to play with.

## Overview

* Minecraft version: 1.19.2
 * This may change moving forward so I'm hoping to use branches or tags to limit particular subsets
* Loader: Forge
* Server: Yes
* Clint: Yes
* Installer: Packwiz (This allows a quick deploy for both client and server installs and works with most installers as long as they support a pre-launch command for an instance)
