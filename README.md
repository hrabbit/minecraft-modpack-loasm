# Lazy On A Sunday Morning

## A modpack purely designed to keep in line with Vanilla Minecraft yet adding some simple quality of life additions for entertainment and longevity of play.

This modpack started as a basic set of mods for myself and my daughter to play Minecraft. I've played plenty of modpacks but she wasn't into the technical packs as much and as such wanted to play Vanilla whenever possible. One set of things we did agree on however, were some quality of life mods that made things far more simpler and less frustrating to play with.

|Requirement|Description|
|---|---|
|Sleeping bag|For carrying a sleeping back and resting anytime without needing to reset your respawn point on death. And of course, hammocks, they just look cool.|
|Backpacks|Carrying stuff back and forth from mining or adventuring, as much as this is part of the grind, is tedious to say the least. Backpacks solve that by just being a great addition to world. Put your stuff into the pack and carry a huge amount more with you.|
||There are a few solutions to this problem so I went with a few offerings in order to better cater to requirements.<br/>\n* Sophisticated backpacks - Modifiers for sorting, filtering, and auto eating are just invaluable in this mod.<br/>\n* Travellers backpack - As above but built in for some parts. Storing fluid and a sleeping bag are nice but slightly more tedious to manage on the road.<br/>\n* Dank storage - Another simple storage solution for the road but also requires a little more understanding to operate.</br>\n|
|Storage|I'm a huge fan of storage solutions and simplified storage overall, things like Tom's Simple Storage, Simple Storage Solution, Refined Storage and Applied Energistics are my favourites overall but my daughter didn't want the coplexity of a full blown automation platform. For this reason, I went with Integrated Dynamics, including Tunnels, Crafting and Terminals. And yes, I agree, it's like having some of the above (ie. RS or AE2), but it also allows for pretty basic storage and piping to be used. Further, I love the idea of learning to program using Integrated Dynamics (although, I'm a developer by day, ID is still a little complicated to me for some things, specifically using predicates).|
|Graves|We used to leave keep inventory on death but that felt like cheating a little too much and often removed the need to preserve your own life, thus causing players to just jump into danger constantly. Adding a grave that needed to be accessed after death certainly added a little more concern the dying but also where you died as it wasn't always easy to return to some places.|
|Chunk loading and anti griefing|This once is purely for pleasure, allowing automation systems to continue operating while not in the area means you can get on with other parts of the game without the need to camp near farms and such to still have resources available.|
|Waystones|We love the travel and adventering involved in the game so finding a waystone or a village with a portal really feels like you have gone further than before but it's a milestone that you can start from on your next adventure.|Beyond the waystones themselves, the waystone mod also adds portals for moving mobs and items around the world without creating crazy contraptions or huge water elevators and things which I find a great positive overall.|
